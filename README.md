## API doc

All routes can be viewed in the [/api-docs route](https:// /api-docs/)
of your deploy (or locally).

- https://localhost:8005/api-docs

Swagger docs are created using open api v3 notations. The docs are found inline
on the router files in `api/**/*Router.js` and use the yaml notation format.
The root of the docs is in `config/jsdoc.js` using the json format.

The following libraries have been used to build and serve the swagger docs live.

- [express-ui](https://github.com/scottie1984/swagger-ui-express)
- [swagger-jsdoc](https://github.com/Surnet/swagger-jsdoc)
